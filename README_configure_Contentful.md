# Configure your own Contentful account

### Step 1. Create an account and a space on Contentful

First, [create an account on Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/sign-up/).

After creating an account, go to the space that you will get automatically upon signing up. Find it in the menu that can be triggered from the top left.

### Step 2. Create a content model

The [content model](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/data-model/) defines the data structures of your application/websites. The structures are flexible and you can tailor them to your needs.

For this example you need to create a content model that defines an author and a post content type. **You can create these two by (a) running a script or (b) by doing it manually** to familiarize yourself with the Contentful user interface.

#### a) Run a script to create the content model

This project includes a setup script which you can use to set up the content model expected by the source code.

In your Contentful dashboard go to **Settings > General Settings** and copy the **Space ID**.

Next, go to **Settings > CMA tokens** and create a new token by clicking **Create personal access token**. This token has the same access rights as the logged in user. **Do not share it publicly**, you will only use it to set up your space and can delete it afterwards.

With the space ID and management access token at hand run the following command:

```
npx cross-env CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=YOUR_SPACE_ID CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=XXX npm run setup
```

You will be prompted to install the cross-env pckage if you don't already have it.

This command will create the needed content structures and set up your Contentful space ready to use. The output should look as follows:

```
> cms-contentful@1.0.0 setup /Users/stefan.judis/Projects/next.js/examples/cms-contentful
> node ./contentful/setup.js $CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID $CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN

#### b) Create the content model manually

##### Create an `Author` content type

From your contentful space, go to **Content model** and add a new content type:

- Give it the **Name** `Author`, the **Api Identifier** should be `author`

Once the content model is saved, add these fields (you don't have to modify the settings unless specified):

- `name` - **Text** field (type **short text**). **Field ID** should be set to `name`
- `picture` - **Media** field (type **one file**). **Field ID** should be set to `picture`

Save the content type and continue.

##### Create a `post` type

From your contentful space, go to **Content model** and add another content type:

- Give it the **Name** `Post`, the **Api Identifier** should be `post`

Next, add these fields (you don't have to modify the settings unless specified):

- `title` - **Text** field (type **short text**)
- `content` - **Rich text** field
- `excerpt` - **Text** field (type **Long text, full-text search**)
- `coverImage` - **Media** field (type **one file**)
- `date` - **Date and time** field
- `slug` - **Text** field. You can optionally go to the settings of this field, and under **Appearance**, select **Slug** to display it as a slug of the `title` field.
- `author` - **Reference** field (type **one reference**)

Save the content type and continue.

### Step 3. Validate your content model

After setting up the content model it should look as follows:

**Content model overview**

### Step 4. Populate Content

Go to the **Content** section in your space, then click on **Add entry** and select the **Author** content type:

- You just need **1 author entry**.
- Use dummy data for the text.
- For the image, you can download one from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

Next, create another entry with the content type **Post**:

- We recommend creating at least **2 post entries**.
- Use dummy data for the text.
- For images, you can download them from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
- Pick the **author** you created earlier.

**Important:** For each entry and asset, you need to click on **Publish**. If not, the entry will be in draft state.

### Step 5. Set up environment variables

From your contentful space, go to **Settings > API keys**. There will be an example Content delivery / preview token - you can use these API keys. (You may also create a new key.)

Then set each variable on `.env.local`:

- `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` should be the **Space ID** field of your API Key
- `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` should be the **[Content Delivery API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/) - access token** field of your API key
- `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN` should be the **[Content Preview API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/) - access token** field of your API key
- `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_SECRET` should be any value you want. It must be URL friendly as the dashboard will send it as a query parameter to enable Next.js Draft Mode
- - `CONTENTFUL_REVALIDATE_SECRET` should be any value you want. This will be the value you pass in as a secret header from the Contentful Webhook settings to use **[On-Demand Revalidation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation)**

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=...
CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=...
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

### Step 6. Run Next.js in development mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
